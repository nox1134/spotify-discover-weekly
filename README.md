Archive each week's Discover Weekly

This repo allows you to automatically archive your Discover Weekly playlist each week in two ways:

1. Your Discover Weekly get stored to a unique playlist called "Discovered Weekly YYYY-MM-DD".
2. Your Discover Weekly gets appended to a single playlist containing all archived Discover Weeklies.

This project uses the Spotify API to get and create the playlists. GitHub Actions are used to automate the workflow.
